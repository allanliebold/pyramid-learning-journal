        "text": "Today we learned about Alchemy. Which doesn't really have anything to do with transmutation. Unless you count taking data and translating it into a sql database, I guess. I did learn about MongoDB in JS401 but from my limited experience I thought getting it to act like a relational database was a bit convoluted. \r\nFor data structures we were introduced to the priority queue. The concept is clear enough, but I haven't thought about how to go about implementing it yet. Something about buckets."

        "text": "We learned about Jinja2 more in-depth after being introduced to it with one of the assignments yesterday. I'm still not that far along in understanding Pyramid at all, so it's a lot to add on to the top of that. \r\nThe Binary Heap data structure is taking a while for me to get. Thinking about it is pretty different compared to our approach last week with nodes and pointers. So it took a while to stop thinking of it in those terms."

        "text": "We got our introduction to the Pyramid framework today. It doesn't seem to be too complicated... but I don't want to make any assumptions about how simple this will be to learn. At first glance it seems like you're given the basic structure and you just make changes and add in what you want... like some sort of framework. Yeah. I followed along decently with the example during lecture, but I need to go over it again. \r\nOther than that we learned about the Double-Ended Queue, or Deque. Nothing too crazy or very different from what we've done so far with data structures."

        "text": "Nothing new today, but it was good to delve into using fixtures in tests. You can never have too many tests. There were a lot of ideas for what to test I hadn't thought of, so they'll be good to consider going forward."
